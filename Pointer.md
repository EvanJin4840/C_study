- Pointer Declaration
  Pointers are declared using the asterisk (\*) symbol followed by the variable name. The syntax is data*type* pointer_name; where the data type matches the type of variable the pointer will reference.

- Address-of Operator (&)
  The ampersand (&) operator retrieves the memory address of a variable. To assign an address to a pointer, use the syntax pointer = &variable.

- Dereference Operator (_)
  The asterisk (_) operator, when used with an existing pointer, accesses the value stored at the memory address the pointer references. This is called dereferencing
